# Convolutional denoising autoencoder for images
This repository stores the code supporting my article: Convolutional denoising autoencoder for images: Theory, design principles and implementation of a convolutional denoising autoencoder.

All the concepts mentioned in the blog are implemented sequentially in the `conv_image.py` python file. Comments are provided wherever necessary. Please see the `imports` for dependencies.

The article associated with this code can be found [here](https://srinjaypaul.github.io/Convolutional_autoencoders_for_images/).
